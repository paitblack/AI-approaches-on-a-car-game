# CENG-3511 Artificial Intelligence Midterm Project
## AI Model's to Run a Game

## :bell: There is a detailed report existing in the repo.    

### :gear: Setup Instructions
- Clone the reposityory. ( git clone https://github.com/paitblack/AI-approaches-on-a-car-game.git )   
- Open any IDE you preferred (Visual Studio etc.)  
- Install required packages (if any).  
- To play the demo game run game.py.   
- To see the reinforcement learning code, look at the DQNmodel.ipynb file.
- To see how works the rule based approach, run ruleBasedBot.py file.
  
### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- **Python** ‚Äî As the main programming language for the entire project 
- **PyGame** ‚Äî For building the game interface and handling graphics and events   
- **TensorFlow** ‚Äî For developing and training the reinforcement learning model.  

### Definition
In this project, we developed a simple 2D driving game where the player controls a vehicle
moving left or right to avoid collisions with incoming traffic and achieve the highest possible
score. To enhance gameplay, we implemented both rule-based and reinforcement learning
bots that can autonomously control the vehicle. The game was built using Pygame, while
Reinforcement Learning model were developed and trained using TensorFlow, the code of
the Rule Based method were developed using pure Python. Our goal was to explore how
different AI approaches perform in a dynamic and increasingly fast-paced environment.
